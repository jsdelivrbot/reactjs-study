Chapter 6 - Components Lifecycle
- Adding a component to the dom -> mounting the component, and unmounting for the inverse task

Chapter 7 - Classes
- An introduction to Classes on ES6 and how React deals with it. The way classes are created and declared is cleaner and things start to be more intuitive.
